## Hi, I'm Otto ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring software developer with a background in audio engineering and tech support.

I recently completed my core studies at [Hive Helsinki](https://hive.fi) (part of the [42 Network](https://www.42network.org)), where I learned the fundamentals of programming by building various challenging solo- and group projects with C and C++ ranging from creating a function library from scratch to 3D graphics projects and creating an IRC-server.

I'm passionate about creative coding and love making things look and feel good. Currently, I am exploring graphics programming with GLSL and Three.js as well as web development with React and TypeScript.

In addition to development, I have a strong interest in integrating sound and technology, having worked on a variety of audio-related projects. This blend of creativity and technical expertise drives my work, whether it's designing interactive experiences or diving deep into complex software development challenges. If I am not working on programming related projects, it's highly likely I'm creating music and/or audiovisual art, and I hope to combine my new programming skills with my creative work.

### Current tools include:
- C, C++, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, GLSL
- React, Node.js, Three.js

Feel free to explore my work, and let's connect!
