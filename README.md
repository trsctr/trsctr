## Hi, I'm Otto ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a recent graduate from [Hive Helsinki](http://www.hive.fi), where I built a strong foundation in software development. Throughout my studies, I gained hands-on experience with languages like C, C++, JavaScript and Python, and tackled a variety of technical challenges that helped me develop my problem-solving skills.

In addition to my programming experience, I have a background in creating music and audiovisual art, blending creativity with technology.

Iâ€™m excited to continue learning, experimenting with new technologies, and applying my skills to real-world projects as well as my creative work.
